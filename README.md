## Custom Work by Prakhar Dewangan (Cisco ASE Prep)

A focused fork to learn **containerlab internals**, build **customer-ready enterprise labs**, and practice **systems engineering workflows** (design → demo → validate → troubleshoot).

### What I did (high-signal)
- Studied containerlab topology lifecycle: node bring-up, link wiring, exec hooks, and lab teardown for repeatable demos.
- Built reusable “lab workflow” patterns: preflight checks, deterministic config push, and post-run validation commands.
- Designed a Cisco-style enterprise scenario lab (routing + segmentation + security posture) and documented it for demo-first walkthroughs.
- Created an integration path with my custom **clabs** lab repository for rapid iteration and portfolio-ready labs.

### Featured Lab (built using containerlab)
- **Cisco Smart Enterprise Network + Security Lab** → *(link to your clabs repo / lab folder here)*

### Skills demonstrated (mapped to Cisco ASE)
- Networking fundamentals: IP addressing, routing, segmentation concepts, security controls (high level)
- Customer problem solving: design choices, tradeoffs, validation steps, troubleshooting checklist
- Collaboration-ready docs: clear run steps, expected outputs, and rollback notes

### Next planned enhancements (in this fork)
- Add a `docs/ase-lab-runbook.md` with:
  - demo script (5–7 mins)
  - validation matrix (expected outputs)
  - troubleshooting playbook (common failures + fixes)
- Add a GitHub Action badge / basic lint check for docs consistency (optional)
